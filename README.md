# My First Bootcamp Challenge Using a Refactor Code
## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

To meet the user story, I had to achieve the following:
- Semantic HTML elements were added throughout the source code
- HTML elements now follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
## Installation
N/A
## Usage
The screenshot shows how the website now looks and its accessibility
